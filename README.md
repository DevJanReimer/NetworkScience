## Abstract

This study analyzes the global semiconductor trade network from 2017–2022, enriching the data of trading countries with their fragility in political stability. Using WTO and World Bank data, it identifies East Asia as a key hub and reveals trade concentration among a few nations. Despite fragility risks, the network shows resilience to political instability, therefore offering crucial insights into the trade sector's dynamics.
